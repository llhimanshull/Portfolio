              Beer Bazzar is an interactive web platform designed to provide extensive knowledge about beer. Built
              using MongoDB, the site efficiently manages data from both users and visitors. The website features a
              dedicated Admin Panel powered by Express.js, allowing authorized personnel to dynamically control
              the site's content and behavior. Leveraging Locomotive JS, EJS, and CSS, the platform ensures
              a smooth and engaging user experience. Visitors can actively participate by writing reviews, which are
              instantly displayed on the site, fostering a vibrant community. The platform also enables the admin or
              designated individuals to create and publish blog posts directly from the site's interface. For enhanced
              security and seamless authentication, the project integrates JWT tokens and cookies. Following the
              Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, the project maintains clean code organization and efficient
              data flow, ensuring scalability and performance.</p>

            <p>
              I developed a robust Car Price Prediction System that integrates frontend, backend, and machine
              learning components to deliver precise vehicle price estimations. The system leverages a Linear
              Regression model trained on a dataset comprising 8,000 raw data entries. To enhance data quality and
              improve prediction accuracy, I applied comprehensive data preprocessing techniques, ensuring the
              dataset was clean and reliable for model training. This rigorous process enabled the model to achieve an
              impressive 86% accuracy, reflecting its effectiveness in predicting car prices accurately. <br><br>

              For data analysis and model evaluation, I employed Weka, which provided valuable insights into data
              trends and model performance. The integration of Weka allowed for effective visualization and analysis,
              further refining the modelâ€™s accuracy and reliability. Through multiple iterations of training and
              testing, I ensured the model was well-optimized to handle real-world data inputs efficiently. <br><br>

            <h5>React , Typescript</h5>
            <p>
              I designed and developed a visually appealing and fully functional Chess Game interface, providing an
              immersive and engaging experience for users. The interface features intuitive design elements that enhance
              gameplay, ensuring smooth interaction and clear visual representation of the chessboard and pieces. <br>
              <br>

              To build this interactive platform, I employed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combining these
              technologies with React.js to deliver a dynamic and responsive user interface. Leveraging Reactâ€™s
              component-based structure allowed for efficient rendering, state management, and seamless updates during
              gameplay. <br> <br>

              The result is a well-structured and engaging chess game that offers both aesthetic appeal and functional
              precision. The interactive design ensures players can easily grasp the gameâ€™s flow, while the responsive
              layout guarantees a consistent experience across various devices.

              I developed Elit Vault, an exclusive invite-only luxury marketplace designed to provide a secure
              and seamless user experience. The platform leverages Spring Boot for backend development, with
              MongoDB as the database solution and Thymeleaf for dynamic content rendering. Following the MVC
              architecture, the project ensures modularity and efficient data flow with dedicated layers for
              beans, controllers, services, DAO, and database connections. A standout feature is the
              robust invitation code validation system, which grants access only to verified users. This feature
              includes dynamic invitation code management, where each code is marked as used upon successful
              registration, minimizing misuse and enhancing platform security. <br><br>

              To enhance usability, I implemented a detailed admin dashboard that provides comprehensive insights
              and control. Admins can efficiently create and manage invitations, track their usage, and oversee
              registered users. The project incorporates precise session management to ensure data privacy and
              secure access control. By emphasizing performance and scalability, the platform efficiently handles
              hundreds of invitations and thousands of user entries with optimized database queries.</p>

              I redesigned the BMW website to deliver a more engaging and interactive user experience by
              incorporating GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for dynamic animations. This redesign focused on
              enhancing visual appeal and improving user engagement through smooth transitions, interactive elements,
              and motion effects. By leveraging GSAPâ€™s powerful animation capabilities, I introduced eye-catching scroll
              animations, hover effects, and fluid page transitions that enriched the browsing experience. The revamped
              design not only improved the site's aesthetics but also ensured better user interaction, making key
              features and content more accessible and enjoyable for visitors.</p>

            <h1>Stiche's</h1>
            <h5>HTML , CSS , Php ,Js </h5>
            <p>
              During my second year of college, I developed Stiche, a full-stack eCommerce website built using
              HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. This project was a significant milestone in my learning
              journey, helping me build a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development.

              For the frontend, I designed an intuitive and visually appealing interface using HTML and CSS,
              ensuring a seamless browsing experience. I incorporated JavaScript to add interactive features and
              dynamic content, enhancing user engagement.

              On the backend, I leveraged PHP to handle server-side logic, including user authentication, order
              management, and database interactions. This hands-on experience introduced me to essential concepts such
              as form handling, session management, and data flow between client and server.

              Building Stiche during my second year not only strengthened my technical skills but also laid a
              solid foundation for my journey into web development.</p>

            <p>
              I redesigned the PhotoDock website to provide a captivating and immersive browsing experience by
              integrating GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for dynamic animations. This redesign emphasized
              enhancing visual appeal and improving user engagement through seamless transitions, interactive elements,
              and motion effects. By harnessing GSAPâ€™s robust animation capabilities, I introduced stunning scroll
              animations, engaging hover effects, and fluid page transitions that elevated the overall user experience.
              The improved design not only showcased wallpapers more elegantly but also made exploring the gallery
              intuitive and enjoyable, ensuring visitors could effortlessly browse and appreciate the visual content.

            <h4>Design UI/UX</h4>
            <h1>Crave Crousel</h1>
            <h5>HTML , CSS , JS (Shery.js)</h5>
            <p>
              I developed Crave Carousel, a website for a local cafÃ© near my house. I noticed the cafÃ© didnâ€™t have
              an online presence, and I thought it would be cool to design one for them. I built the website's
              frontend using HTML, CSS, and Shery.js, a JavaScript library known for its smooth
              animations and interactive elements.

              The website featured an inviting design that showcased the cafÃ©'s ambiance, menu, and special offers.
              Leveraging Shery.js, I incorporated engaging animations and seamless transitions to enhance the user
              experience. This project not only allowed me to apply my frontend development skills but also helped
              me understand the importance of creating visually appealing and user-friendly designs.

              Building Crave Carousel was a rewarding experience that allowed me to contribute to my local community
              while improving my web development skills.
